## Talks

### Keynote, [Artificial intelligence to stop dyslexia](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/inteligencia-artificial-acabar-dislexia/), by [Luz Rello](https://twitter.com/luzrello)

Dyslexia is not related to any kind of intelligence. It means a very intelligent person can have dyslexia.

People with dyslexia are able to read, with the *same understanding*, texts with errors, without errors or with flipped characters. People without dyslexia read much worse when texts contain errors.

It wasn't a technical talk, but lot's of studies about dyslexia have been supported by technology: eye tracking, statistics,...

**¿Einar es disléxico? Confunde mucho la `a` y la `e` al leer y le cuesta hacer dibujos simétricos (cuando para otras tareas parece que la abstracción espacial la tiene bastante buena).**

### [The Future of the Conversational UIs](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/the-future-the-conversational-uis/), by [Jorge del Casar](https://twitter.com/JorgeCasar)

Several phases: design, implementation, test, deploy. Very similar to software development. Not sure why the speaker didn't match both *worlds*.

The design phase is the more important one in conversational UIs, in contrast with traditional UIs. It's very important to think about use cases up front.

1. There must be a Persona, so users will *feel* the conversation
2. Think out of the box: every user is different, every user will lead the conversation in different ways. Conversations are not as simple as Command-Response. There are several contexts, several meanings,...

There are tons of tools to create conversational UIs

- Server side: Luis (Microsoft), IBM Watson,... All of them are cloud based, and they require a lot of time preparing and making the tool learning about your use cases.
- SDKs, to implement your client side: ActionsSDK, MS Bot Framework,...

The subject looks interesting, but it seems to be companies are trying to sell their cloud based tool, and that tool is *basically* a speech-2-text tool. Some companies are moving forward, but the core business is simple, and they're selling it as a complex business you can't do without them.

The speaker said nothing about Evie :P

**Feedback**

:( Parece que faltaba un poco de preparación a la charla, los ejemplos parecían inventados en el momento, fallos en el texto de las slides (copy&paste?)
