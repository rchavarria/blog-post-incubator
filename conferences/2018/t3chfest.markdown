## Talks

### Keynote, [Artificial intelligence to stop dyslexia](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/inteligencia-artificial-acabar-dislexia/), by [Luz Rello](https://twitter.com/luzrello)

Dyslexia is not related to any kind of intelligence. It means a very intelligent person can have dyslexia.

People with dyslexia are able to read, with the *same understanding*, texts with errors, without errors or with flipped characters. People without dyslexia read much worse when texts contain errors.

It wasn't a technical talk, but lot's of studies about dyslexia have been supported by technology: eye tracking, statistics,...

**¿Einar es disléxico? Confunde mucho la `a` y la `e` al leer y le cuesta hacer dibujos simétricos (cuando para otras tareas parece que la abstracción espacial la tiene bastante buena).**

### [The Future of the Conversational UIs](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/the-future-the-conversational-uis/), by [Jorge del Casar](https://twitter.com/JorgeCasar)

Several phases: design, implementation, test, deploy. Very similar to software development. Not sure why the speaker didn't match both *worlds*.

The design phase is the more important one in conversational UIs, in contrast with traditional UIs. It's very important to think about use cases up front.

1. There must be a Persona, so users will *feel* the conversation
2. Think out of the box: every user is different, every user will lead the conversation in different ways. Conversations are not as simple as Command-Response. There are several contexts, several meanings,...

There are tons of tools to create conversational UIs

- Server side: Luis (Microsoft), IBM Watson,... All of them are cloud based, and they require a lot of time preparing and making the tool learning about your use cases.
- SDKs, to implement your client side: ActionsSDK, MS Bot Framework,...

The subject looks interesting, but it seems to be companies are trying to sell their cloud based tool, and that tool is *basically* a speech-2-text tool. Some companies are moving forward, but the core business is simple, and they're selling it as a complex business you can't do without them.

The speaker said nothing about Evie :P

**Feedback**

:( Parece que faltaba un poco de preparación a la charla, los ejemplos parecían inventados en el momento, fallos en el texto de las slides (copy&paste?)

### [So, you think the technology is neutral?](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/crees-que-la-tecnologia-es-neutra/), by [esus M González Barahona](https://twitter.com/jgbarah)

Very, very interesting talk about technology, not the technical side, but the human and the social side of it. It's a pity it's in Spanish, the speaker provides more questions than answers. The talk is full of *food for thought*.

Technology enables (affords, make it possible, give power,...), but also, technology constraints (limits you,...)

Tech decissions today constraint what we'll be able to do in the future, even more than politics.

Technology is made by humans, if we don't like, we should be able to change it. 

But that's usually not involved in social discussions, social debates. We don't usually ask ourselves (as a society) what technology enables or constraints.

There are three kind of communication services:

1. Centralized
2. Federated
3. Peer to peer

What is the easiest to control? What enables innovation best?

Who's able to update your car's software? Would it be ok if the owner could update it? Replace car with refrigerator, phone, coffee machine,... How many companies know where you are right now?

The speaker mentioned the well known battle: security Vs freedom

Who's responsible about what you can and can't see on the Internet?

Problem is not if a company (say Facebook, Twitter, Google) censors some content. Problem is that a company, a private company can censor, that it's legal for a company to censor, that it's socially accepted a company can censor. Possible solution? more computer power and storage, cheaper cpu and storage, less energy consumption, more mobility. More connectivity, faster, cheaper. Better federated technologies, better p2p communications.

**Trends**

Code and law: historcally, law is who constraint society. nowadays, technology constraints us. Most of the time, law is behind technology

War against general purpose computer: speciallization, almost all electronic devices work with software, but you're not able to decide what kind of software makes them work (car, coffe machine, washer,...)

Hardware + Software: knowledge that works. Code is not only the recipe, it also cooks the dish.

In the 80's, there were people that thought software should allow much more than it did, that way is how Open Source was born

### [Contactless magnetic mechanisms for aerospace and robotic applications](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/contactless-magnetic-mechanisms-for-aerospace-and-robotic-applications/), by [Ignacio Valiente-Blanco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-valiente-96528a2b) and [Judit Esnoz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judit-esnoz-larraya-05388882)

It was not a software related talk, but it was about engineering.

Magnetic mechanisms: it replaces parts of a tradicional mechanism (gear,...) with magnetic devices: plain magnets, materials made of iron (ferrites, soft-magnetic materials,...), materials that are source of magnetic fields.

Those devices doesn't have the same limitations as tradicional ones: there is no friction, no contact, so lubricant oil is not needed, what means less maintenance.

Their best product is a [magnetic gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP5ah6tEi04). They use magnets to transfer movement from one side to another, reducing the rpm's (revolution per minute) by 7, 50 or hundreds of times. (7 Hz to 1 Hz)

Another product, [z-damper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hswcmO7wiBA). It's based on a magnetic break (trains break with magnetic fields through the wheels). It slows down something in movement. It's used in airplains to reduce vibrations.

Superconductors: they are electric resistance free, some of them emit magnetic field. They did a demo where a piece of metal was at very low temperature, and it floated in the air (similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EaZCaH0t78) ).

### [Side-projects for fun and learning](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/side-projects-fun-and-learning/), by [Marta Cruz](https://twitter.com/espoletavt) and [Daniel Villalobos](https://twitter.com/dvillalobos) - [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQGKlndXer_IGM7Y3IpRpahgbeoqngGnk4r1RWHhzEhWKuhhn4lq6T0T9sg-RC9RQ6jLGdK-PpzRS2-/pub#slide=id.g335b6d559c_0_0)

It's impossible to know everything, you have to choose. Try to find the sweet spot in: passion + creativity + try new things + enjoy

Use side projects to learn something new, to learn something quite different of what you use in your day to day job, to learn and experiment with other people, to get experience without a formal job

Side project elements:

1. Passion
2. Start small
3. No pressure
4. Make it simple

Benefits: learning, enjoy, shared knowledge,...

Phases:

1. Idea
2. Debate, discussion: to improve the first idea
3. Validate
4. MVSP (most valuable side-project)
5. Demo, share

Experiment without fear, a side project is a project where failure is wellcomed. Do it right, do it with love

Speakers talked about side projects as if they should be done as part of a team, within the company. I think they just expose their experience. It could be told from a wider perspective

### [Let's understand what is reactivity](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/programa/entendamos-la-reactividad/), by [José Manuel García](https://twitter.com/semagarcia) - [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/sema_hkd/t3chfest-2018-entendamos-de-una-vez-qu-es-eso-de-la-reactividad), [code](https://github.com/semagarcia/rxjs-t3chfest-reactividad)

What's reactivity/reactivex? It's a paradigm to work with asynchronous data streams

Any value that changes over time is a good candidate to be *observed*. After that, you'll see *observables* anywhere, and you're right!

JavaScript is asynchronous: callbacks, promises, generators, async/await

Observables **are** functions. They do nothing until you invoke them, they're lazy. They do someting any time you invoke them, by subscribing to them

`subscribe` method returns a subscription object that allows managing the subscription: unsubscribe,... Useful to avoid memory leaks (BTW, I didn't know you should unsubscribe from them to avoid memory leaks)

A subscription ends when:

1. Data stream is over
2. Client unsubscribes

`Subject` can play both roels: publisher and subscriber. The speaker built a state machine UI, publishing events in an observable, and observing them in another component inside the application. [Angular app showing it](https://github.com/semagarcia/rxjs-t3chfest-reactividad/tree/master/07-subject-t3chfy)

Operator: function that receives an `Observable` as param and returns another `Observable`. They can be chained. There are operators to do almost anythin. They are the interesting part of ReactiveX

**Feedback**

:) Live (and visual) examples in browser console

:) Nice example with the lottery (slide #23)
